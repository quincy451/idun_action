# VM ABI for Bootstrap ActionC64U Runtime

This ABI is still intentionally small, but `vm.com` is now a real stack
interpreter rather than a print-only placeholder.

## VM State

- one 16-bit data stack (`32` cells in the current runner)
- `16` 16-bit local slots
- one current string pointer set by `setp16`

All immediate addresses are payload-relative offsets inside the active `.avm`.

## Intrinsic Pseudo-Targets

`calln` uses reserved pseudo-addresses:

- `0xff00`: `Print`
- `0xff10`: `PrintE`
- `0xff20`: `Exit`
- `0xff30`: `PrintI`
- `0xff31`: `PrintIE`
- `0xff40`: `ReuAlloc`
- `0xff41`: `ReuFree`
- `0xff42`: `ReuPeek8`
- `0xff43`: `ReuPoke8`
- `0xff44`: `ReuPeek16`
- `0xff45`: `ReuPoke16`
- `0xff50`: `ConIn`
- `0xff51`: `ConOut`
- `0xff60`: `FileOpenRead`
- `0xff61`: `FileCloseRead`
- `0xff62`: `FileRead8`
- `0xff63`: `FileOpenWrite`
- `0xff64`: `FileCloseWrite`
- `0xff65`: `FileWrite8`
- `0xff66`: `FileDelete`

These are not final machine addresses. `vm.com` recognizes them directly.

REAL arithmetic is intentionally not listed here as VM pseudo-targets. REAL32
support is expected to come from link-time runtime modules selected per used
operator, so programs that do not use a REAL operation do not pay for that code
in the interpreter or in their linked payload.

## REAL Runtime Helper ABI

REAL helpers are normal linked AVO routines, not AVM intrinsics and not
AVMRUN-resident opcode handlers.

The current REAL32 stack convention is:

- one REAL32 value occupies two 16-bit stack cells
- the low word is pushed before the high word
- `RT_F_ADD`, `RT_F_SUB`, `RT_F_MUL`, and `RT_F_DIV` consume `lhs.low`,
  `lhs.high`, `rhs.low`, `rhs.high`
- REAL operator helpers return `result.low`, `result.high`

ACTC currently lowers `R=A+B`, `R=A-B`, `R=A*B`, and `R=A/B` by loading
`A.low`, `A.high`, `B.low`, and `B.high`, calling only the matching helper, then
storing the returned high word and low word into `R`. ALINK emits the high-word
accesses as ordinary `LOAD` / `STORE` against the variable address plus two
bytes.

## Runtime Opcode Subset

The bootstrap interpreter operates on 16-bit stack cells. Arithmetic wraps at
16 bits, comparisons return `0` or `1`, and `lt` / `gt` use signed 16-bit
comparison.

The bitwise and shift opcodes are unsigned 16-bit primitives intended for
runtime libraries such as REAL32 helpers:

- `band`: pop two cells, push `lhs & rhs`
- `bor`: pop two cells, push `lhs | rhs`
- `bxor`: pop two cells, push `lhs ^ rhs`
- `shl1`: pop one cell, push `(value << 1) & 0xffff`
- `shr1`: pop one cell, push logical `value >> 1`

## Semantics

### `Print`

- input: current string pointer from `setp16`
- effect: print the string with no newline
- return: continue execution

### `PrintE`

- input: current string pointer from `setp16`
- effect: print the string followed by the standard CP/M newline sequence
- return: continue execution

### `Exit`

- input: none
- effect: terminate the current payload/program cleanly
- return: does not return to the caller

### `PrintI` / `PrintIE`

- input: pop one 16-bit value from the stack
- effect: print signed decimal, with `PrintIE` adding a newline
- return: continue execution

### REU Intrinsics

- `ReuAlloc`: pop `size`, push `handle`
- `ReuFree`: pop `handle`
- `ReuPeek8`: pop `offset`, `handle`; push zero-extended byte
- `ReuPoke8`: pop `value`, `offset`, `handle`
- `ReuPeek16`: pop `offset`, `handle`; push 16-bit value
- `ReuPoke16`: pop `value`, `offset`, `handle`

Current stack operands are 16-bit, so the first runtime REU path is aimed at
buffers and offsets within the low 64 KiB of a handle. The underlying backend
API remains 32-bit for future expansion.

### Console Intrinsics

- `ConIn`: push one input character from the CP/M console
- `ConOut`: pop one byte and write it to the CP/M console

### File Intrinsics

Current file I/O is intentionally small and text-oriented.

- `FileOpenRead`: pop payload-relative filename string offset, push `1` on success else `0`
- `FileCloseRead`: push `1` when the active read stream closes cleanly else `0`
- `FileRead8`: push next byte from the active read stream, or `0xffff` on EOF
- `FileOpenWrite`: pop payload-relative filename string offset, push `1` on success else `0`
- `FileCloseWrite`: flush and close the active write stream, push `1` on success else `0`
- `FileWrite8`: pop one byte and append it to the active write stream
- `FileDelete`: pop payload-relative filename string offset, push `1` on success else `0`

Current behavior notes:
- one active read stream and one active write stream are supported
- `FileOpenWrite` truncates or recreates the target file
- `FileRead8` treats `0x1a` as text EOF, matching the bootstrap text-file use case
- `FileWrite8` writes through 128-byte CP/M records and pads the final record on close

## Bootstrap Compiler Pattern

The host reference compiler can now emit direct runtime file I/O for:

- `FileCopy("source.txt", "dest.txt")`
- `FilePrint("dest.txt")`

These compile to the `FileOpenRead`, `FileRead8`, `FileOpenWrite`,
`FileWrite8`, close, and console-output intrinsics listed above.

The CP/M `actc.com` target still emits the older print-oriented pattern while
its memory image remains tight:

1. `setp16 <string_offset>`
2. `calln 0xff00` or `calln 0xff10`
3. `calln 0xff20`

Direct AVM assembly and host-compiled AVM output can use the wider
opcode/intrinsic subset.

## AVMRUN Execution Modes

`AVMRUN.PRG` has two execution paths:

- a fast Acheron path for payloads made only of opcodes whose byte values and
  semantics are compatible with the bundled AcheronVM
- an internal stack interpreter for the bootstrap AVM opcode set

Bootstrap stack and memory opcodes such as `push16`, `load`, and `store` are
not Acheron-compatible byte-for-byte. `AVMRUN.PRG` must therefore force the
internal interpreter when those opcodes appear. This is required for linked REAL
runtime helpers that use the bootstrap stack ABI.
