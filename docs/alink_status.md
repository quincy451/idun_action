# `ALINK` Status

Current as of `2026-04-09`.

This file is a focused ledger for the UDOS-native `ALINK.PRG` tool.
It tracks the real linker slice separately from the broader [action_matrix.md](/mnt/c/test/action/actionc64u/docs/action_matrix.md).

## Proven On The Committed Baseline

- [x] Launches from a UDOS Action workspace as `ALINK.PRG <module>`
- [x] Loads deterministic `AVO1` object stubs from `OBJ/`
- [x] Parses export metadata
- [x] Parses `body_ops`
- [x] Parses unresolved external symbol lines
- [x] Parses integer literal pools
- [x] Parses string literal pools
- [x] Uses compiler-emitted export sizes to recover procedure boundaries
- [x] Builds a live-set from the requested module entry
- [x] Resolves the current narrow external-object closure by loading child objects
- [x] Carries child-object int/string pools into the linked image
- [x] Emits direct binary `AVM1` to `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
- [x] Narrow exact-byte proof exists for the emitted image
- [x] Narrow integrated proof exists through `ALINK -> AVMRUN`
- [x] Narrow integrated proof also exists through `ACTC -> ALINK -> AVMRUN`

## Proven Linker Behaviors

- [x] dead-strip on the current narrow local/export graph
- [x] child object loading for the already-proven narrow object shape
- [x] final binary target path `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
- [x] direct binary output instead of text or planning-report output

## Current Widening Work

- [ ] broader object graph / external-resolution surface
- [ ] more robust child-object load path under the current dirty VICE debug line
- [ ] more robust final save/return path under the current dirty VICE debug line
- [ ] larger body-op surface than the current arithmetic/procedure/branch/`WHILE`/nested-loop-combined slice
- [ ] full historical dead-strip/link behavior

## Current Biggest Blockers

- Call-depth / return-context sensitivity around tool ABI file loads and saves.
  This is still the biggest blocker on the VICE-facing path. The harness now proves the widened linker logic itself on the current additive slice.
- Proof friction from VICE automation.
  This is real, but secondary. It slows narrowing because some dirty lines perturb shell launch, mount timing, or prompt detection before the actual linker boundary is reached.
- Lack of a small, stable comparator for every dirty line.
  When the control path itself gets perturbed, it becomes harder to make honest claims about whether the next failure is in `ALINK` or in the shared tool/service context.

## How Current Debugging Relates To The Linker

The current debugging is directly about core linker function, not side work.

`ALINK` only becomes meaningfully functional when it can:

1. load the root object
2. load child objects for unresolved externals
3. build the final live image
4. save `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
5. hand that image to `AVMRUN`

The active failures are in steps `2` and `4` on the widened dirty line, so the current work is still central linker work.

## What Is Not Claimed Here

- full ACTION! linker coverage
- full historical module/runtime graph support
- stability for every currently dirty widening experiment
