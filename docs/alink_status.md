# `ALINK` Status

Current as of `2026-04-19`.

This file is a focused ledger for the UDOS-native `ALINK.PRG` tool.
It tracks the real linker slice separately from the broader [action_matrix.md](/mnt/c/test/action/actionc64u/docs/action_matrix.md).

## Proven On The Committed Baseline

- [x] Launches from a UDOS Action workspace as `ALINK.PRG <module>`
- [x] Loads deterministic `AVO1` object stubs from `OBJ/`
- [x] Parses export metadata
- [x] Parses `body_ops`
- [x] Parses unresolved external symbol lines
- [x] Parses integer literal pools
- [x] Parses string literal pools
- [x] Uses compiler-emitted export sizes to recover procedure boundaries
- [x] Builds a live-set from the requested module entry
- [x] Resolves the current narrow external-object closure by loading child objects
- [x] Carries child-object int/string pools into the linked image
- [x] Emits direct binary `AVM1` to `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
- [x] Narrow exact-byte proof exists for the emitted image
- [x] Narrow integrated proof exists through `ALINK -> AVMRUN`
- [x] Narrow integrated proof also exists through `ACTC -> ALINK -> AVMRUN`
- [x] Current shipped UDOS build links again under the real target after widening the tool load window from `$2000` to `$4000`
- [x] Current workspace exporter is green again with `--build-udos-tools`

Current real-target build note:

- `./tools/build_alink_udos.sh` is green again
- `make -C ../udos vice-action-alink` is green again on the current working tree
- `make -C ../udos vice-action-alink-avmrun` is green again on the current
  working tree
- `make -C ../udos vice-action-actc-alink-avmrun` is green again on the current
  working tree
- current shipped `ALINK` map footprint is:
  - `CODE`: `$204B`
  - `BSS`: `$0B06`
  - total runtime span from `$0900` through `$3450`
- the previous real-target `LOAD FAIL`/save-return blocker is cleared for the
  current narrow object/link/runtime slice

## Proven Linker Behaviors

- [x] dead-strip on the current narrow local/export graph
- [x] child object loading for the already-proven narrow object shape
- [x] final binary target path `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
- [x] direct binary output instead of text or planning-report output

## Current Widening Work

- [ ] broader object graph / external-resolution surface
- [ ] more robust child-object load diagnostics for future wider object graphs
- [ ] more robust final save/return diagnostics for future larger outputs
- [ ] larger body-op surface than the current arithmetic/procedure/branch/`WHILE`/nested-loop-combined slice
- [ ] broader variable/data surface beyond the current multi-var module-scope integer storage/read/write/control slice
- [ ] broader procedure/function surface beyond the current local/external integer arg/return slice
- [ ] full historical dead-strip/link behavior

## Current Biggest Risks

- Call-depth / return-context sensitivity around tool ABI file loads and saves.
  The current narrow VICE-facing path is green again, but this remains the
  first risk area when widening child-object loading or final output size.
- Proof friction from VICE automation.
  This is real, but secondary. It slows narrowing because some dirty lines perturb shell launch, mount timing, or prompt detection before the actual linker boundary is reached.
- Lack of a small, stable comparator for every dirty line.
  When the control path itself gets perturbed, it becomes harder to make honest claims about whether the next failure is in `ALINK` or in the shared tool/service context.

## How Current Debugging Relates To The Linker

The current debugging is directly about core linker function, not side work.

`ALINK` only becomes meaningfully functional when it can:

1. load the root object
2. load child objects for unresolved externals
3. build the final live image
4. save `BIN/<NAME>.AVM`
5. hand that image to `AVMRUN`

The active failures are in steps `2` and `4` on the widened dirty line, so the current work is still central linker work.

## What Is Not Claimed Here

- full ACTION! linker coverage
- full historical module/runtime graph support
- stability for every currently dirty widening experiment
