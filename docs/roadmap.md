# ActionC64U Roadmap

## Phases

### Phase A
Host harness + CP/M user-mode emulation (`cpmemu`).

### Phase B
Integrate AcheronVM and run bytecode programs.

### Phase C
Minimal Action compiler (host reference compiler first).

### Phase D
Language expansion + dead-strip linker.

### Phase E
REAL32 implementation.

### Phase F
REU + overlays (simulated first, then VICE validation).

### Phase G
Release disk image (C64 CP/M-65) with tools + examples + automated verification.

## Progress Log (Append-Only)

- 2026-03-03: Bootstrap repository created with initial structure, docs seeds, inspiration copy script, and smoke tests.
- 2026-03-06: Added WSL2 environment probe/setup scripts, local path validation, and non-destructive tooling tests.
- 2026-03-06: Added a cpmemu runner, CP/M-65 build notes, and skip-aware host harness tests for adjacent cpm65-u64 builds.
- 2026-03-06: Added a hello.com smoke program, ABI notes, and a build path that prefers native CP/M-65 ASM with llvm-mos fallback.
- 2026-03-06: Added AcheronVM planning docs, a staged vmhello proof source, and blockers-aware build/test plumbing for the VM backend.
