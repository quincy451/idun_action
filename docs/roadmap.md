# ActionC64U Roadmap

## Phases

### Phase A
Host harness + CP/M user-mode emulation (`cpmemu`).

### Phase B
Integrate AcheronVM and run bytecode programs.

### Phase C
Minimal Action compiler (host reference compiler first).

### Phase D
Language expansion + dead-strip linker.

### Phase E
REAL32 implementation.

### Phase F
REU + overlays (simulated first, then VICE validation).

### Phase G
Release disk image (C64 CP/M-65) with tools + examples + automated verification.
