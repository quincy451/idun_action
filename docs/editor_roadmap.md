# `ACTEDIT` Source Editor Roadmap

Current as of `2026-07-18`.

## Active Idun/Linux Fork

The active `actedit` is a C++ Linux process in `src/tools_linux`. It uses
`std::string` and `std::vector` for source text, supports print, append, insert,
replace, and delete operations, and always uses its own editor on a terminal.
Plain `actedit <module>` uses an uncolored display; `actedit <module> tui`
enables syntax colors. `$EDITOR` is deliberately ignored. A current-directory
`<module>.ACT` takes precedence over the structured project's
`SRC/<module>.ACT`. The built-in editor has:

- Action-aware color classes for keywords/types, builtins, constants, strings,
  numbers, and comments
- a blinking block cursor over an inverse-video cell, plus Home/End and Page
  Up/Page Down navigation with horizontal scrolling
- character insertion, line split/join, Backspace, Delete, and four-space Tab
- `Ctrl-S` atomic save and guarded `Ctrl-Q` discard/quit
- `F1` help for the token under the cursor, with a scrollable popup
- `F2` help explaining every editor keyboard and mouse command
- `F3` hierarchical language reference over every cataloged core feature
- `F4` library and feature lists with explanations and an example for every
  feature
- `F5` definition, `F6` in-memory ACTSPC formatting, `F7` references,
  Alt-left/right history, and Ctrl-click definition navigation through ALINK's
  SQLite semantic map
- internal block mark/copy/cut/paste/delete/replace operations and left-button
  drag selection

### Active block editing

`Ctrl-B` sets the selection anchor at the cursor; subsequent cursor movement
extends the selected character range across any number of lines. Pressing
`Ctrl-B` again or Escape clears the selection without changing text. `Ctrl-A`
selects the entire buffer. The selected range is shown in inverse video in
both plain and highlighted modes.

`Ctrl-C` copies the selection, `Ctrl-X` copies and removes it, and `Ctrl-V`
inserts the session clipboard at the cursor or replaces the current selection.
Backspace and Delete remove a selection without changing the clipboard, while
typing, Tab, or Enter replaces it. A left-button drag establishes the same
selection as the keyboard anchor; a plain click repositions the cursor, and
Ctrl-click performs definition lookup. Clipboard contents live only for the
current ACTEDIT process and are not written to C64 memory or SQLite.

F6 runs the exact syntax-aware formatter used by standalone ACTSPC against the
current in-memory buffer. It does not silently save: a changed buffer is marked
dirty and still requires `Ctrl-S`. ACTSPC/F6 use four spaces per structural
level, compact symbolic operators and commas, one space between language words,
LF endings, no tabs or trailing whitespace, and no repeated blank lines. String
contents and comment text remain unchanged; ASMBLOCK labels and instructions
receive assembly-aware indentation.

The same external `action-help.sqlite3` catalog drives highlighting, F1, F3,
F4, and the `acthelp` command. The catalog contains 260 authored
language/runtime topics and is validated against the compiler builtin/constant
tables and every declaration under `lib/*.act` during each build. Every topic
must include an example. It is not loaded wholesale: the editor performs
case-insensitive SQLite lookups and loads reference lists only when requested.

Scriptable/navigation modes remain available:

- `actedit <module> index`: transactionally rebuild the project index
- `actedit <module> find <text>`: search all indexed source lines without a
  result-count cap
- `actedit <module> symbols`: list indexed declarations for the module

The rebuildable project index lives in `.action/workspace.sqlite3`; the help
catalog is a separate read-only build/export artifact. SQLite is host-side
workspace infrastructure only; generated C64 programs do not depend on it.
The process port is complete: invoking `actedit <module>` uses the built-in,
uncolored editor on a terminal and prints source when noninteractive. Explicit
`tui` mode uses the same editor with syntax highlighting. F1 provides Action
token help, F2 opens an in-editor keyboard/mouse command reference, F3 opens
the language browser, F4 opens the library browser, F5/F7 navigate linked code,
and F6 formats the buffer. ACTEDIT does not
dispatch to `$EDITOR` or any other external editor. The `compile`, `build`,
and `debug` modes drive the native ACTC/ALINK/ACTDBG workflow in-process.

## Historical UDOS Design

The design below is retained as historical context. Its `ACTEDIT.PRG`, REU,
overlay, key-binding, UDOS save, and UDOS command-chaining details are not the
active implementation or verification path for the Idun fork.

This document defines the intended UDOS-native source editor for Action
projects.

The editor is not a minor convenience. It is a core development tool, and it
must be designed around:

- large source files
- REU-backed storage
- 40-column screen limits
- integration with compile/build/debug flows

## Goal

Provide a real full-screen source editor for Action project files with:

- vertical scrolling
- horizontal scrolling
- insert/delete editing
- mark/copy/cut/paste/delete block operations
- load/save
- goto line
- find/replace
- project integration

Planned tool:

- `ACTEDIT.PRG`
- `ACTEDIT_OVL1.BIN` native mutation overlay

## Current Baseline

Today the repo has:

- `ACTSRC.PRG` for manifest/source listing
- `ACTFILE.PRG` for source viewing/printing
- `ACTMON.PRG` for project-front-end dispatch
- `ACTEDIT.PRG` as a first REU-backed full-screen editor bootstrap slice

So today the project can inspect and make narrow interactive edits to sources
in a real full-screen tool, but it is still well short of the intended final
editor.

Current `ACTEDIT` bootstrap behavior:

- accepts `ACTEDIT <NAME>` and resolves `SRC/<NAME>.ACT`
- accepts `ACTEDIT SRC/<NAME>.ACT`
- accepts `ACTEDIT <NAME-OR-PATH>:<LINE>` and opens that exact 1-based line;
  malformed, zero, out-of-range, and overflowing locations fail explicitly
- stages the source file into REU and addresses immutable source bytes with
  24-bit offsets through a small resident cache, including files larger than
  64 KiB
- keeps immutable source at REU bank `$07` and above, clear of the editor's
  fixed undo, redo, metadata, and add-buffer workspaces in banks `$03-$06`
- builds a batched 24-bit source-line index immediately after the staged file,
  so line lookup and streamed save no longer rescan immutable source from byte
  zero
- builds a persistent edited-document line index in REU banks `$00-$02`; each
  three-byte entry names a derived piece plus its 16-bit line offset, so normal
  navigation and save use direct logical-line lookup after the index is built
- rewrites only the affected logical-index suffix after direct patch, insert,
  delete, split, join, and paste mutations, while retaining full rebuilds for
  initial derivation, undo/redo restore, and fallback; all 65,535 logical line
  numbers remain clear of undo/redo storage in banks `$03-$04`
- directly replaces a clean source-line piece with source/patch/source spans and
  persists that updated piece table without reconstructing descriptors
- directly inserts new INSERT pieces for both source-line and inserted-line
  splits, removes source/PATCH/INSERT pieces for join and multiline delete, and
  keeps general multiline paste on those direct primitives
- updates text in an existing INSERT slot without invalidating an otherwise
  unchanged piece table or logical index
- loads the bounded `AEOV` native mutation overlay once into RAM under BASIC
  ROM at `$A000`; missing, oversized, or malformed overlays leave direct
  mutation disabled and preserve correctness through the descriptor rebuild
  path
- renders a full-screen source view
- supports cursor-up/cursor-down line browsing
- uses left/right as an edit cursor with horizontal scroll
- supports typed character insertion on the current line
- supports delete-left editing on the current line
- supports `RETURN` line split and delete-at-column-0 line join
- supports logical-line mark/copy/cut/paste/delete with:
  - `F3` mark anchor
  - `F5` copy selection
  - `F6` cut selection
  - `F7` paste clipboard
  - `DELETE` delete selection without replacing the clipboard
- supports search/navigation helpers:
  - `F2` find next current token or current-line marked selection
  - `F4` find previous current token or current-line marked selection
- supports prompt-driven helpers:
  - `Ctrl-G` goto line
  - `Ctrl-R` replace next match for the current token or current-line marked
    selection
  - `Ctrl-A` replace every literal match in the document as one undoable edit
- supports non-text navigation helpers:
  - `HOME` line home, then file top when already at column `0`
  - `INS` line end, then file bottom when already at line end
  - `CLR/HOME` page up
  - `F8` page down
- supports a small REU-backed undo/redo journal:
  - `Ctrl-U` walks backward through the last few mutating edit states
  - `Ctrl-Y` walks forward through the currently redoable edit states
  - current depth is `32`
- keeps dirty state
- preserves edited lines plus limited inserted/deleted line structure through a
  logical-line model whose patch/insert/delete descriptor tables live in
  REU-backed metadata windows, whose patch/insert line payload text lives in
  an append-only REU add buffer behind a shared resident edit-text window, and
  whose visible line loads now rebuild through a small resident piece window
  over that REU-backed state
- supports up to `64` active patch, insert, and delete descriptors and a
  `255`-entry derived piece window; navigation preserves requested line numbers
  while a dirty piece table is rebuilt
- saves back to the source file with `F1` through streamed UDOS writes
- saves and hands off through direct-program workflow keys:
  - `Ctrl-O` queues `ACTC <MODULE>;` to compile the current module and return
    to the failing source line on a compiler error
  - `Ctrl-B` queues `ACTC <MODULE>,`; ACTC then queues ALINK after a successful
    object write
  - `Ctrl-D` queues `ACTC <MODULE>:`; ACTC queues ALINK and ALINK queues ACTDBG
    only after each preceding output succeeds
- derives the shared uppercase module name from both `NAME` and
  `SRC/NAME.ACT` editor entry forms
- accepts ACTDBG's compact source-path/line handoff and positions the editor at
  the debugger's currently browsed linked source location
- supports clean quit back to UDOS with `RUN/STOP`, clearing the full-screen
  canvas before the shell redraws its prompt

Current `ACTEDIT` bootstrap footprint:

- `ACTEDIT.PRG`: `16243`
- resident span: `$0900-$4870`
- resident `CODE`: `$3F71`
- resident `ZPTEMP`: `$001E`
- mutation overlay: `1758` bytes at `$A000-$A6DD`
- free resident margin below the `$4AFE` UDOS floor: `653` bytes

Current `ACTEDIT` bootstrap limits:

- clean source-line patches, source/insert splits, source/PATCH/INSERT removals,
  joins, and multiline paste now mutate and persist the derived piece table
  directly; dirty-cache, undo/redo restore, capacity, and I/O fallback paths
  still rebuild from the metadata-authoritative descriptor model
- the full `255`-entry piece cache remains resident rather than using a small
  working window over an unconstrained REU descriptor stream
- the edited-document line index is persistent and direct mutations rewrite
  only the affected suffix; initial derivation and fallback still rebuild it
  from the resident piece window
- undo/redo remains a bounded `32`-entry snapshot journal rather than compact
  piece transactions

## Core Decision

The editor must be REU-backed from the start.

A plain in-RAM whole-file editor will fail too early and then force a rewrite.
That is the wrong path.

The editor should treat normal RAM as:

- screen/view state
- cursor state
- command state
- small working caches

And treat REU as:

- original file store
- appended edit store
- piece descriptors
- copy/paste buffer
- optional undo records

## Buffer Model

Planned document model: REU-backed piece table.

Why this is the right fit:

- original file stays immutable in REU
- inserted text appends to a second REU region
- the visible document is a sequence of pieces
- cut/copy/paste become descriptor edits instead of whole-file shifts
- save is a streaming walk over the piece list
- large-file support becomes practical

Planned REU regions:

- original file data
- add buffer
- piece descriptor table
- copy buffer
- optional undo journal

Planned resident RAM data:

- current piece/cache window
- current line index cache
- viewport render buffer
- status line state
- key-command state

## View Model

The editor is full-screen, not line-at-a-time shell editing.

Planned screen use on a 40x25 display:

- top status row
  - file/module name
  - dirty flag
  - mode
  - line/column
  - left-column offset
- main text viewport
  - the visible source window
- bottom command/message row
  - prompts
  - errors
  - search/replace input

Horizontal scrolling is required, not optional.

That means the editor tracks:

- current line
- current column
- top visible line
- left visible column

## Command Surface

The exact key map can change later. The command set should not.

Required first-class operations:

- cursor up/down/left/right
- page up/page down
- line home/end
- file home/end
- scroll left/right
- insert character
- delete character
- backspace
- split line
- join line
- mark start/end
- copy block
- cut block
- delete block
- paste block
- save
- quit
- goto line
- find
- replace

Useful later additions:

- single-line undo, then multi-step undo
- duplicate line/block
- comment/uncomment block
- compile/build/debug current module

## File Model

The editor should work directly with project source files:

- `SRC/<NAME>.ACT`

Planned entry paths:

- `ACTEDIT <NAME>`
- `ACTEDIT SRC/<NAME>.ACT`
- `ACTMON EDIT <NAME>`

Save should stream directly through the existing UDOS file-save services.

This should reuse the project/file helper layer already used by:

- `ACT2SAVE`
- `ACTFILE`
- `ACTSRC`
- `ACTMON`

## Large File Direction

The editor must not assume source files fit in plain C64 RAM.

Current large-file foundation:

- load the file into REU
- address immutable source with 24-bit offsets and a 255-byte resident window
- count and render source across 64 KiB REU bank boundaries
- build a batched, persistent 24-bit index for immutable source-line starts
- build a separate persistent logical-line index over source, patch, and insert
  pieces in REU banks `$00-$02`
- use those indexes for direct line lookup and linear streamed save

Remaining large-file strategy:

- keep only a small render/index working set resident
- scroll, edit, and save by walking indexed piece spans

This is consistent with the compiler direction already chosen:

- large source and metadata live in REU
- resident RAM holds only the active working window

## Copy Buffer

Block operations require a real copy buffer, not only line delete/paste.

Planned copy buffer behavior:

- block copy writes into REU-backed copy storage
- block cut edits the piece table and also fills that copy storage
- paste inserts a new piece sequence referencing copy-buffer data

This avoids repeated whole-document moves.

## Search / Replace

Search and replace should also be REU-aware.

Current bootstrap behavior:

- literal ASCII search
- forward and backward search
- replace next and whole-document replace all
- replace-all advances past inserted replacement text, so replacements that
  contain the search text terminate correctly
- replace-all is recorded as one undo operation

Regex-style search is not a goal.

## Integration With Compiler And Debugger

The editor should become the place where project work starts.

Current integration:

- compile, build, and debug commands save the current module and use the fixed
  UDOS program-chain service
- ACTC queues ALINK only after successful object output
- ALINK queues ACTDBG only after successful direct-PRG and debug-sidecar output
- all stages use the same derived module name and ordinary direct PRGs
- ACTDBG `E` queues `ACTEDIT <SOURCE-PATH>:<LINE>` for the currently browsed
  linked source record; commands that cannot fit UDOS's 31-byte chain ABI are
  rejected rather than truncated
- ACTC's compile-only `;`, build `,`, and debug `:` modes queue
  `ACTEDIT <MODULE>:<LINE>` after a source diagnostic; plain `ACTC <MODULE>`
  retains its nonzero failure return without an editor handoff
- failure handoffs use the same strict 31-byte chain bound and do not truncate
  long module commands

That means `ACTEDIT`, `ACTC`, `ALINK`, and `ACTDBG` should share the same
module/path conventions.

## Relationship To The Old ACTION! Editor

The old ACTION! editor is a useful behavioral reference, not a strict
compatibility target.

Good features worth keeping in spirit:

- horizontal scrolling
- block copy/delete/paste
- goto file top/end
- find/replace
- monitor/editor handoff

What matters is matching the capability set, not reproducing every historic
key binding exactly.

## Planned Phases

### Phase 1

- `ACTEDIT.PRG` exists
- load one source file
- cursor movement
- vertical scrolling
- horizontal scrolling
- quit cleanly back to UDOS
- REU-backed source staging
- 24-bit immutable-source addressing across REU banks
- insert/delete/backspace
- dirty-state tracking
- streamed save
- split/join line

### Phase 2

- mark/copy/cut/delete/paste block operations
- goto line
- find
- replace current
- simple copy buffer persistence during one session

### Phase 3

- multi-step undo is available through the current `32`-entry journal
- replace all is available as one undoable operation
- compile/build hooks are available through `Ctrl-O` and `Ctrl-B`
- debugger handoff is available through `Ctrl-D`
- debugger-to-editor source-location return is available through ACTDBG `E`
- project-aware open/create flows through `ACTMON`

## Practical Next Implementation Steps

1. replace full-state undo snapshots with compact piece transactions so history
   is not constrained by the current `32`-entry rings
2. replace the full resident `255`-piece cache with a paged REU descriptor
   working set
3. add richer project-aware open/create handoff through `ACTMON`
